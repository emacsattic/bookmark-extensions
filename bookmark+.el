;;
;;(@* "Bookmark+ Features")
;;  ** Bookmark+ Features **
;;
;;  In addition to the kinds of bookmarks provided by vanilla Emacs:
;;
;;    - You can bookmark a buffer that is not associated with a file.
;;
;;    - You can bookmark a region in a W3m buffer or a Gnus message.
;;
;;    - For any bookmark (except Gnus), you can bookmark a region of
;;      text, not just a position.  By default, when you jump to a
;;      bookmark that records a region, the region is activated.  See
;;      option `bookmarkp-use-region-flag'.  `C-u' reverses the
;;      behavior specified by the value of the option.
;;
;;    - Better bookmark relocation, if the contextual text changes.
;;
;;(@* "How To Use Bookmark+")
;;  ** How To Use Bookmark+ **
;;
;;  Put this library in your `load-path'.
;;  Add this to your init file (~/.emacs) : (require 'bookmark+)
;;
;;  Some of the commands defined here bind `S-delete', to delete the
;;  current bookmark candidate during completion in Icicle mode (see
;;  Icicles: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles).
;;
;;(@* "Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el')")
;;  ** Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el') **
;;
;;  Library `bookmark+.el' is generally compatible with GNU Emacs
;;  versions 20 through 23.
;;
;;  1. All bookmarks created using any version of vanilla Emacs
;;     (library `bookmark.el') continue to work with `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;  2. All bookmarks created using library `bookmark+.el' will work
;;     with all Emacs versions (20-23), provided you use library
;;     `bookmark+.el' to access them.
;;
;;  3. Most bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el' will not interfere
;;     with the behavior of vanilla Emacs, versions 21-23.  The new
;;     bookmark types are simply ignored by vanilla Emacs.  For
;;     example:
;;
;;    - A bookmark with a region is treated like a simple position
;;      bookmark: the destination is the region start position.
;;
;;    - A Gnus bookmark does not work; it is simply ignored.
;;
;;  However, there are two cases in which `bookmark+.el' bookmarks
;;  will raise an error in vanilla Emacs:
;;
;;  * You cannot use non-file bookmarks with any version of vanilla
;;    Emacs.
;;
;;  * You cannot use any bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el' with
;;    vanilla Emacs 20.
;;
;;    The Emacs bookmark data structure has changed from version to
;;    version.  Library `bookmark+.el' always creates bookmarks that
;;    have the most recent structure (Emacs 23).  As is the case for
;;    any bookmarks that have the Emacs 23 structure, these bookmarks
;;    will not work in vanilla Emacs 20 (that is, without
;;    `bookmark+.el').
;;
;;  Bottom line: Use `bookmark+.el' to access bookmarks created using
;;  `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;(@* "New Bookmark Structure")
;;  ** New Bookmark Structure **
;;
;;  The bookmark data structure, variable `bookmark-alist', has been
;;  enhanced to support the new bookmark types.  For a description of
;;  this enhanced structure, use `C-h v bookmark-alist'.

Bookmark functions update the value automatically.
You probably do not want to change the value yourself.

The value is an alist with entries of the form
 (BOOKMARK-NAME . PARAM-ALIST)
or the deprecated form (BOOKMARK-NAME PARAM-ALIST).

 BOOKMARK-NAME is the name you provided for the bookmark.
 PARAM-ALIST is an alist of bookmark information.  The order of the
  entries in PARAM-ALIST is not important.  The possible entries are
  described below.  A nil value means the entry is not used.

Bookmarks created using vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el'):

 (filename . FILENAME)
 (position . POS)
 (front-context-string . STR-AFTER-POS)
 (rear-context-string  . STR-BEFORE-POS)
 (annotation . ANNOTATION)
 (handler . HANDLER)

 FILENAME names the bookmarked file.
 POS is the bookmarked buffer position (position in the file).
 STR-AFTER-POS is buffer text that immediately follows POS.
 STR-BEFORE-POS is buffer text that immediately precedes POS.
 ANNOTATION is a string that you can provide to identify the bookmark.
  See options `bookmark-use-annotations' and
  `bookmark-automatically-show-annotations'.
 HANDLER is a function that provides the bookmark-jump behavior
  for a specific kind of bookmark.  This is the case for Info
  bookmarks, for instance (starting with Emacs 23).

Bookmarks created using Bookmark+ are the same as for vanilla Emacs,
except for the following differences.

1. If no file is associated with the bookmark, then FILENAME is nil.

2. The following additional entries are used.  Their values are
non-nil when a region is bookmarked; they are nil otherwise.  When a
region is bookmarked, POS represents the region start position.

 (buffer-name . BUFFER-NAME)
 (end-position . END-POS)
 (front-context-region-string . STR-BEFORE-END-POS)
 (rear-context-region-string . STR-AFTER-END-POS))

 BUFFER-NAME is the name of a bookmarked buffer, which might not be
  associated with any file (see #1).
 END-POS is the region end position.
 STR-BEFORE-END-POS is buffer text that precedes END-POS.
 STR-AFTER-END-POS is buffer text that follows END-POS.

 NOTE: The relative locations of `front-context-region-string' and
 `rear-context-region-string' are reversed from those of
 `front-context-string' and `rear-context-string'.  For example,
 `front-context-string' is the text that *follows* `position', but
 `front-context-region-string' that *precedes* `end-position'.

3. The following additional entries are used for a Gnus bookmark.

 (group . GNUS-GROUP-NAME)
 (article . GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER)
 (message-id . GNUS-MESSAGE-ID)

 GNUS-GROUP-NAME is the name of a Gnus group.
 GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER is the number of a Gnus article.
 GNUS-MESSAGE-ID is the identifier of a Gnus message.

4. For a W3m bookmark, FILENAME is a W3m URL.")

 * If in W3m mode, then the current W3m title.

 * Otherwise, the current buffer name.

While entering a bookmark name at the prompt:
